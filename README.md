# The User Entry.

## How sophisticated can a user entry app be?

### You tell me.

### Highlights

- Uses material design to the fullest
- Uses GreenDao for db
- Uses Firebase wrapped in OkHttp for persistent API calls (no need for syncing logic)
- Leverages the Google vision API (via play services) for Drivers License Scanning
- Added my own custom animations
- Uses Dagger for injections (ouch)
- Uses Butterknife
- Many more

The goal of the project was to use different APIs of interest whilst trying to keep boiler plate code to the absolute minimum.

- All assets in this app are gotten from [Material Icons](https://design.google.com/icons/)
- All code in this project is written by me, helper libraries have their authors and license info.
